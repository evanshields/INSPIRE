## Formula Reference

### Debt Service Calculations

**Monthly Principal & Interest (Amortization):**
```
P = L × [r(1+r)^n] / [(1+r)^n - 1]

Where:
  P = Monthly payment
  L = Loan amount
  r = Monthly interest rate (annual rate / 12)
  n = Total number of payments (months)
```

**DSCR:**
```
DSCR = Qualifying Monthly Rent × 12 / (Monthly PITIA × 12)

Or: Annual Qualifying Rent / Annual Debt Service
```

**Monthly PITIA:**
```
Monthly PITIA = Monthly P&I + Monthly Taxes + Monthly Insurance + Monthly HOA

Where:
  Monthly Taxes = Annual Property Taxes / 12
  Monthly Insurance = Annual Hazard Insurance / 12
  Monthly HOA = HOA assessment (already monthly)
```

### Valuation Calculations

**Loan-to-Value (LTV):**
```
LTV = Loan Amount / As-Is Value
```

**Loan-to-Cost (LTC):**
```
LTC = Total Loan Amount / Total Cost Basis

Cost Basis (Purchase) = Purchase Price + Closing Costs + Assignment Fees
Cost Basis (Refinance) = Original Purchase + Completed Rehab Costs
```

**Loan-to-After-Repair Value (LTARV):**
```
LTARV = Loan Amount / After-Repair Value
```

**Cap Rate:**
```
Cap Rate = Annual NOI / Property Value
```

**Rent-to-Value:**
```
Rent-to-Value = Annual Rent / Property Value
```

### Borrower Classification (RTL)

**Total Points:**
```
Total Classification Points = Credit Decision Score + Experience Score

FICO Scoring:
  ≥700 points = 3 points
  680-699 = 1 point
  <680 = 0 points

Experience Scoring (36-month lookback):
  10+ deals = 7 points
  3-9 deals = 5 points
  0-2 deals = 1 point

Classification:
  ≥7 points = A+
  5-6 points = A
  2-4 points = B
  <2 points = C
```

### ARM Interest Rate Calculation

**Fully-Indexed Rate:**
```
Fully-Indexed Rate = Index + Margin

Example:
  SOFR (Index) = 5.33%
  Margin = 5.00%
  Fully-Indexed Rate = 10.33%

Subject to Floor and Caps:
  If Fully-Indexed > Rate Cap Limit → Use Cap
  If Fully-Indexed < Floor → Use Floor
```
