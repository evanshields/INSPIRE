# Revision Summary: Sections 1, 3, and 5 (Investor-Validated)

## Overview
Based on comprehensive review of all investor guidelines (ArchWest RTL/DSCR, EastView RTL/DSCR/GUC), the following revisions are required for Sections 1, 3, and 5 of the USDV Underwriting Manual. These revisions synthesize conflicting guidelines using precedence rules:
- **DSCR Products**: EastView guidelines take precedence
- **RTL Products**: ArchWest guidelines take precedence

---

## SECTION 1: Investment Philosophy & Loan Products

### Critical Corrections

#### 1.1 Loan Products - Bridge Plus (NEW)
**Finding**: Bridge Plus is not a separate product in ArchWest, but IS defined in EastView RTL Guidelines as a distinct 25-36 month term product for stabilized properties.
**Action**: Add Bridge Plus as a distinct product tier between Bridge and DSCR.

#### 1.2 Loan Amount Ranges
| Product | ArchWest | EastView | Unified |
|---------|----------|----------|---------|
| Fix & Flip | $150K-$3.5M | $100K-$3M | $100K-$3M |
| GUC | $236K-$5M | $150K-$1.5M* | $150K-$1.5M* |
| Bridge | $150K-$3.5M | $100K-$3M | $100K-$3M |
| Bridge Plus | N/A | $100K-$3M | $100K-$3M |
| DSCR | $75K-$3.5M | $100K-$3M | $100K-$3M |

*GUC max $1.5M standard; up to $2M on exception

#### 1.3 Loan Term Corrections
- **Fix & Flip**: ArchWest 6-24mo; EastView 12-24mo → **Unified: 12-24 months**
- **GUC**: ArchWest 12-24mo; EastView 12-24mo → **Unified: 12-24 months** ✓ (no change needed)
- **Bridge**: ArchWest 6-24mo; EastView 12-24mo → **Unified: 12-24 months**
- **Bridge Plus**: NEW - 25-36 months (EastView RTL only)

#### 1.4 GUC Minimum Experience Clarification
- **ArchWest**: 3 deals in last 36mo; OR 2 deals + Licensed GC + 2x liquidity + 720 FICO
- **EastView**: A+ = 10+, A = 5+, B = 1+ (min 740 FICO for B)
- **Unified**: 3 deals in last 36 months (standard); OR 2 deals + Licensed GC + 2x liquidity + 720 FICO (alternative)

#### 1.5 FICO Score Corrections
- **EastView RTL/GUC**: 660 minimum ✓ (correct as drafted)
- **EastView DSCR**: 660 minimum (NOT 680)
- **ArchWest DSCR**: 680 minimum
- **Unified DSCR**: 680 minimum (using ArchWest precedence for DSCR)

#### 1.6 Property Type Eligibility - Key Changes
**GUC**: 
- ArchWest: SFR, Townhome, 2-4 Unit, 5-9 Unit
- EastView: SFR, Townhome, Condo, 2-4 Unit (NO 5-9 Unit)
- **Unified**: SFR, Townhome, 2-4 Unit (Condo on case-by-case; NO 5-9 Unit)

**Bridge Plus**:
- New product; uses RTL guidelines
- Eligible: SFR, Townhome, Condo, 2-4 Unit (same as Bridge)

#### 1.7 Series LLC Status
- **ArchWest DSCR**: INELIGIBLE ("Series LLCs are ineligible borrowing entities")
- **EastView**: No specific mention
- **Unified**: NOT eligible for DSCR; RTL to be determined case-by-case

---

## SECTION 3: Entity & Guarantor Analysis

### Critical Corrections

#### 3.1 Guarantor Requirement - Key Change
| Source | Requirement |
|--------|-------------|
| ArchWest | 51% aggregate OR 20%+ individual owners |
| EastView | "At least 51%" OR "100%" preferred |
| **Unified** | **At least 51% minimum; 100% preferred** |

**Finding**: Both investors allow 51% minimum as alternative, but conflict on whether 20%+ owners must separately guarantee.
**Action**: Unify to 51% minimum aggregate; any owner with 20%+ must be identified; may be included in 51% aggregate.

#### 3.2 Recourse Structure - Warm Body Waiver
**ArchWest DSCR allows waiver if:**
- Entity has >250% net worth of loan amount AND
- Entity has >100% liquidity of loan amount

**EastView**: States "100% of entity ownership" but allows "at least 51%" on exception basis

**Unified**: 100% personal guarantees preferred; 51% minimum on exception basis with strong compensating factors.

#### 3.3 Series LLC - Explicit Ineligibility for DSCR
**Finding**: ArchWest explicitly states "Series LLCs are ineligible borrowing entities" for DSCR.
**Action**: Update Section 3.2 to mark Series LLCs as ineligible for DSCR products.

#### 3.4 Revocable Trusts - Guarantor Clarification
**ArchWest DSCR**: "Revocable trust requires trustee and owner of the trust" to guarantee
**EastView**: Lists "Trust" as eligible borrowing entity but doesn't specify guarantor

**Unified**: Revocable Trusts require trustee AND grantor/owner to execute personal guarantees.

#### 3.5 Entity Experience Requirements
**Finding**: Both investors require owners to have real estate experience commensurate with loan product.
**Action**: Strengthen wording in Section 3 to tie guarantor experience to loan product requirements (cross-reference Section 2).

---

## SECTION 5: Property Eligibility Standards

### Critical Corrections

#### 5.1 Non-Warrantable Condominiums - Major Conflict
| Source | Position |
|--------|----------|
| ArchWest RTL | **INELIGIBLE** (explicit) |
| ArchWest DSCR | **INELIGIBLE** (explicit) |
| EastView RTL | Eligible (definition provided) |
| EastView DSCR | Eligible with -10% LTV reduction |
| **Unified** | **RTL: Case-by-case per EastView; DSCR: Eligible with conditions** |

**Action**: Update Section 5.2.2 to show non-warrantable condos as:
- RTL: Conditional (case-by-case review required)
- DSCR: Eligible with -10% LTV reduction

#### 5.2 Minimum Square Footage - Discrepancy
| Property Type | ArchWest | EastView | Unified |
|---------------|----------|----------|---------|
| SFR | 700 sq ft | 600 sq ft | **700 sq ft** |
| Townhome | Not specified | 600 sq ft | **700 sq ft** |
| Condo | <500 SF ineligible | 500/unit | **500 sq ft per unit** |
| 2-4 Unit | Not specified | 500/unit | **500 sq ft per unit** |

**Rationale**: Using higher ArchWest standard for SFR (stronger underwriting).

#### 5.3 Acreage Limitations - Reconciliation
| Source | Requirement |
|--------|-------------|
| ArchWest | 5+ acres **INELIGIBLE** |
| EastView | 5+ acres by exception; 10+ acres **INELIGIBLE** |
| **Unified** | <5 acres standard; 5+ acres by exception; 10+ acres ineligible |

**Action**: Update Section 5.6.3 to clarify exception process for 5-9.99 acre properties.

#### 5.4 Property Condition - C5 Allowance
**Finding**: Both ArchWest and EastView allow C5 for RTL with detailed rehab plan, but NOT for DSCR.
**Action**: Section 5.5.1 is correct; reinforce in text that C5 is RTL-only with caveats.

#### 5.5 Rural Property Definition
**EastView RTL/GUC**: "Properties not located in Rural areas (as defined in the appraisal)"
**ArchWest DSCR**: "No rural properties. Rural is generally defined if CFPB Rural and Underserved Designation website equals 'yes'; provided however, to the extent the designation is 'yes' and the property is less than a 50 minute commute to a secondary market location that has a minimum population of 250,000 based on MSA population then the SVP of Credit may designate as a non-rural property."

**Unified**: Use CFPB Rural Designation as primary tool; exceptions possible for properties within 50-minute commute to MSA 250K+.

#### 5.6 Condo Warrantability Criteria - Alignment
**All investors use similar warrantable/non-warrantable definitions:**
- Project must be completed
- Developer HOA control transferred to owners
- Single entity ownership <10% (or specified threshold)
- No excessive STR allowance
- <50% rental occupancy
- No pending litigation
- Commercial space <25% of building
- <15% units in arrears

**Action**: Section 5.7.1 criteria are largely correct; add cross-reference to Fannie Mae guidelines as validation source.

## SECTION 1: Python Code Corrections

### LoanProductValidator Class - Corrections Needed

**Current Issues:**
1. GUC minimum experience set to 3 deals (correct)
2. GUC max amortization term 18 months (INCORRECT - should be 12-24 months)
3. No Bridge Plus product defined
4. DSCR min FICO set to 680 (correct for unified)
5. Loan amount ranges need verification

**Required Updates:**
```python
# GUC Term - should be 12-24, not 12-18
GUC_min_term = 12
GUC_max_term = 24

# Add Bridge Plus
LoanType.BRIDGE_PLUS = "Bridge Plus"
BRIDGE_PLUS_min_term = 25
BRIDGE_PLUS_max_term = 36

# GUC max loan amount
GUC_max_loan = 1_500_000

# Add conditional checks for GUC alt experience pathway
# 2 deals + 720 FICO + 2x liquidity + Licensed GC
```

---

## SECTION 3: Python Code Corrections

### EntityAnalyzer Class - Corrections Needed

**Current Issues:**
1. Guarantor ownership threshold set to 20% (partially correct - should be 51% aggregate minimum)
2. No handling of Series LLC ineligibility for DSCR
3. No trust-specific guarantor requirements

**Required Updates:**
```python
# Change structure to:
# 1. Minimum 51% aggregate guarantors required
# 2. Any owner 20%+ should be identified and may be included in 51%
# 3. Series LLC ineligible for DSCR products
# 4. Revocable trusts require trustee + grantor guarantee
```

---

## SECTION 5: Python Code Corrections

### PropertyEligibilityChecker Class - Corrections Needed

**Current Issues:**
1. Condo eligibility logic doesn't distinguish RTL vs DSCR
2. Non-warrantable condo handling too strict
3. Minimum square footage for SFR should be 700, not variable
4. Acreage handling allows 5+ without exception flag

**Required Updates:**
```python
# Add loan_type parameter to relevant methods
# Update condo logic:
if property_type == CONDOMINIUM and loan_type == DSCR:
    if not is_warrantable:
        ltv_impact -= 0.10  # -10% LTV reduction
        is_eligible = True
elif property_type == CONDOMINIUM and loan_type in RTL_PRODUCTS:
    if not is_warrantable:
        warnings.append("Case-by-case review required")
        is_eligible = True  # Conditional

# Fix SFR minimum square footage
if property_type == SFR:
    min_sf = 700  # Not 600
```

**Answer**: Revocable trusts require trustee AND grantor/owner of trust to execute personal guarantees
**Source**: ArchWest DSCR Guidelines (page 5, Recourse section)

### Q3.3: Limited Partnership Guarantor Requirements

**Leverage Reductions**:
- EastView: HPA < -10% = -5% LTV (RTL/GUC); ZHVI 200-300% = -5% LTV
- ArchWest: Similar thresholds
**Source**: EastView RTL Guidelines (page 10, "Area Conformity Assessment")

### Q5.5: Short-Term Rental (STR) Income Documentation Period

## New Open Questions for USDV

1. **USDV Exception Approval Authority**: Who approves non-warrantable condos, acreage >5, and other exceptions?
2. **Condo Reserve Requirement**: Does USDV have a specific minimum reserve funding requirement (e.g., 10%)?
3. **Series LLC Policy**: Are Series LLCs eligible for RTL products, or universally ineligible?
4. **GUC Alternative Experience Pathway**: Does USDV accept 2 deals + Licensed GC + 2x liquidity + 720 FICO as alternative to 3 deals?
5. **Affiliate Guarantor Policy**: Does USDV require guaranties from individuals controlling the borrower through affiliated entities?
